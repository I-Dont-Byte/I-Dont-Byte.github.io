					<p>Losing My Marbles is a game that will put your reaction speed to the test. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, you must sort all the incoming marbles to their designated location. It may seem easy at first; however, the marbles will start to speed up as time goes on. Once you feel like you have mastered the game in normal mode, challenge yourself by attempting to conquer the advanced mode. Here the game will dare you with sorting twice as many colors at a faster speed. Bring your analytical skills and quick fingers unless you want to lose your marbles!
