					<td>	<p>My name is Abdullah Mousa, and I am currently in my freshman year 
						<br> at the <a href = "uri.edu">University of Rhode Island</a>. I'm studying for a BS in Computer
						<br> Science, and hopefully will be going into more of a software
						<br> engineering career after graduation. I attended a Cyber Security 
						<br> course offered at MIT in 2018 and enjoyed the experience. </p></td>

					<td>Outside of school, I like to spend my time working on programming projects
						<br>and going hiking when I can. I am a 4th Dan Black Belt in TaeKwonDo.
						<br>I spend my summers visiting family in Rhode Island and going on road trips
						<br>in the US and Europe. Despite being an American, due to my father's employment,
						<br>I grew up as an ex-pat. I have never lived in the US. Hopefully, once things start
						<br>to clear up with the pandemic, I'll be able to live with my grandfather in Exeter
						<br>and attend URI on campus.</td>
